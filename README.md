â€©This is stage 3 of our website that will offer two main functionalities in Iteration 3.
First, is to offer a Kindergarten routing map which will help the user to spot the nearest kindergarten from their home address along with the navigational route to the chosen childcare.
Second, the users will navigate their way by completing a five-step questionnaire kinder journey specifically tailored for migrant parents to provide them with a personalised view regarding diverse community settlements along with data trends related to childcare costs and public and private kindergartens. The users will also receive kindergarten recommendations based on which they can compare Kindergartens with respect to kinder types, area and national quality standard ratings.
